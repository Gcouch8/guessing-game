Project: Guessing-Game

This code will start a Guessing-game once opened. There are 6 questions total. The code will alert the user of their input and store their input in a variable. It will then alert the user of whether their input was correct and matched the answer stored in a variable. After the game is over, the code will alert the user of how many questions they got correct.
