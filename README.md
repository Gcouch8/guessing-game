====Guessing Game====

When the button is clicked, the GuessingGame function constructor will run the runGame function. Which will then access the arrays that have the data for each question, answer, response, and image. Depending on the user input, the output will be displayed either on the page or through alerts. If the user got the question correct they will get a custom response and an image to be displayed. If the user got the question incorrect, a different custom response will be displayed. At the end of the game a counter variable will dispay how many questions the user got correct.


A joke for the TAs: "Why did the programmer quit his job? Because they didn't get arrays!"

Yay, puns!
