    <h1>How well do you know Gareth?</h1>

    <h2>The script has preset variables with the right answers</h2>

    <h2>The script then prompts the user for input. It checks the input against the preset variables and also stores the user input in their own variables.</h2>

    <h3>Depending on the user input the code using an if else statement will ouptut an alert to the user whether they got the question correct or incorrect. It will then output a custom message for what the right answer is. This is for the first 3 questions.</h3>

    <h4>For the 4th question I used an if else if else statement for guessing my age. If the age is correct it will output a correct message, if the answer is greater than the answer it will display a custom message telling the user the answer is too high. If the user input is less than the answer, it will display a custom message that the answer is too low.</h4>

    <p>I set a counter variable at the top of the script, and then included the counter in the if statements as counter++, so if they got the question correct it keeps track of their right answers. At the end of the guessing game, the script will send the user an alert with using the counter variable to tell them how many questions out of 4 they got correct.</p>
